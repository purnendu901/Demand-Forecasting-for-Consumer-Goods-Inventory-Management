# Demand-Forecasting-for-Consumer-Goods-Inventory-Management
Feature Extraction: Identified key features such as seasonality, trends, pricing, promotions, and economic indicators.

Forecasting Techniques: Employed ARIMA, SARIMA, FB Prophet, and LSTM for time series forecasting.

Model Comparison: Compared performance of different models to minimize mean squared error.

Accuracy Metrics: Assessed model accuracy using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and forecast bias.

Real-World Data Application: Applied the best-performing model to real-world sales data.

Inventory Optimization: Utilized forecasts to optimize inventory levels, reducing stockouts and excess inventory.

Enhanced Strategies: Improved production planning and procurement strategies based on accurate demand predictions.
